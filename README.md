## „ÄΩÔ∏èIntroduction:
Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding failures, and verifying that the software product is fit for use.<br>
Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. In general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or system under test:<br>

- meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
- responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,
- performs its functions within an acceptable time,
- is sufficiently usable,
- can be installed and run in its intended environments
- achieves the general result its stakeholders desire

As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources. As a result, software testing typically (but not exclusively) attempts to execute a program or application with the intent of finding failures due to software faults. The job of testing is an iterative process as when one fault is fixed, it can illuminate other failures due to deeper faults, or can even create new ones.<br>
Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and risk of its failure to users or sponsors.<br>
Software testing can be conducted as soon as executable software (even if partially complete) exists. The overall approach to software development often determines when and how testing is conducted. For example, in a phased process, most testing occurs after system requirements have been defined and then implemented in testable programs. In contrast, under an agile approach, requirements, programming, and testing are often done concurrently.<br>

## Chapter 2
- ### SDLC models
It is the first approach and the basic model used in software development. It is a simple model that is easy to use as well as understand. The execution happens in the sequence order, which means that the outcome of the one-stage is equal to the input of another stage. That's why it is also known as the Linear-sequential life cycle model.<br>
To avoid the overlapping issues of the multiple phases, every stage should be completed before moving to the next stage. Each stage of the waterfall model involves the deliverable of the previous stage, like requirements, are transferred to the design phase, design moved to development, and so on. When we have the Life critical (hospital application) and Machine critical (Military project), we will widely use the waterfall model.<br>

## Chapter 3
- ### Types of Testing
Manual testing is a software testing process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tool. All test cases executed by the tester manually according to the end user's perspective. It ensures whether the application is working, as mentioned in the requirement document or not. Test cases are planned and implemented to complete almost 100 percent of the software application. Test case reports are also generated manually.<br>
Manual Testing is one of the most fundamental testing processes as it can find both visible and hidden defects of the software. The difference between expected output and output, given by the software, is defined as a defect. The developer fixed the defects and handed it to the tester for retesting.<br>
Manual testing is mandatory for every newly developed software before automated testing. This testing requires great efforts and time, but it gives the surety of bug-free software. Manual Testing requires knowledge of manual testing techniques but not of any automated testing tool.<br>

## Chapter 4
- ### Types of Manual
The box testing approach of software testing consists of black box testing and white box testing. We are discussing here white box testing which also known as glass box is testing, structural testing, clear box testing, open box testing and transparent box testing. It tests internal coding and infrastructure of a software focus on checking of predefined inputs against expected and desired outputs. It is based on inner workings of an application and revolves around internal structure testing. In this type of testing programming skills are required to design test cases. The primary goal of white box testing is to focus on the flow of inputs and outputs through the software and strengthening the security of the software.<br>
The term 'white box' is used because of the internal perspective of the system. The clear box or white box or transparent box name denote the ability to see through the software's outer shell into its inner workings.<br>
Developers do white box testing. In this, the developer will test every line of the code of the program. The developers perform the White-box testing and then send the application or the software to the testing team, where they will perform the black box testing and verify the application along with the requirements and identify the bugs and sends it to the developer.<br>

## Chapter 5
- ### White Box Techniques
Data flow testing is used to analyze the flow of data in the program. It is the process of collecting information about how the variables flow the data in the program. It tries to obtain particular information of each particular point in the process.<br>
Data flow testing is a group of testing strategies to examine the control flow of programs in order to explore the sequence of variables according to the sequence of events. It mainly focuses on the points at which values assigned to the variables and the point at which these values are used by concentrating on both points, data flow can be tested.<br>

## Chapter 6
- ### Black Box Techniques
Decision table technique is one of the widely used case design techniques for black box testing. This is a systematic approach where various input combinations and their respective system behavior are captured in a tabular form.<br>
That's why it is also known as a cause-effect table. This technique is used to pick the test cases in a systematic manner; it saves the testing time and gives good coverage to the testing area of the software application.<br>
Decision table technique is appropriate for the functions that have a logical relationship between two and more than two inputs.<br>

## Chapter 8
- ### Types of Functional
Unit testing involves the testing of each unit or an individual component of the software application. It is the first level of functional testing. The aim behind unit testing is to validate unit components with its performance.<br>
A unit is a single testable part of a software system and tested during the development phase of the application software.<br>
The purpose of unit testing is to test the correctness of isolated code. A unit component is an individual function or code of the application. White box testing approach used for unit testing and usually done by the developers.<br>

## Chapter 10
- ### Test case development
Testing documentation is the documentation of artifacts that are created during or before the testing of a software application. Documentation reflects the importance of processes for the customer, individual and organization.<br>
Projects which contain all documents have a high level of maturity. Careful documentation can save the time, efforts and wealth of the organization.<br>

## Chapter 11
- ### Testing Techniques
The test case design technique or methods or approaches that need to be followed by every test engineer while writing the test cases to achieve the maximum test coverage. If we follow the test case design technique, then it became process-oriented rather than person-oriented.<br>
The test case design technique ensures that all the possible values that are both positive and negative are required for the testing purposes. In software testing, we have three different test case design techniques which are as follows:<br>
- Error Guessing
- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis[BVA]

## Chapter 12
- ### Test Management
A test plan is a detailed document which describes software testing areas and activities. It outlines the test strategy, objectives, test schedule, required resources (human resources, software, and hardware), test estimation and test deliverables.<br>
The test plan is a base of every software's testing. It is the most crucial activity which ensures availability of all the lists of planned activities in an appropriate sequence.<br>
The test plan is a template for conducting software testing activities as a defined process that is fully monitored and controlled by the testing manager. The test plan is prepared by the Test Lead (60%), Test Manager(20%), and by the test engineer(20%).<br>

## Chapter 14
- ### Other types of Testing
Regression testing is a black box testing techniques. It is used to authenticate a code change in the software does not impact the existing functionality of the product. Regression testing is making sure that the product works fine with new functionality, bug fixes, or any change in the existing feature.<br>
Regression testing is a type of software testing. Test cases are re-executed to check the previous functionality of the application is working fine, and the new changes have not produced any bugs.<br>
Regression testing can be performed on a new build when there is a significant change in the original functionality. It ensures that the code still works even when the changes are occurring. Regression means Re-test those parts of the application, which are unchanged.<br>

## Chapter 15
- ### Software Testing Tools
Software testing tools are required for the betterment of the application or software.<br>
That's why we have so many tools available in the market where some are open-source and paid tools.<br>
The significant difference between open-source and the paid tool is that the open-source tools have limited features, whereas paid tool or commercial tools have no limitation for the features. The selection of tools depends on the user's requirements, whether it is paid or free.<br>

## Chapter 16
- ### Differences
Automation testing is a process of changing any manual test case into the test scripts by using automation testing tools, and scripting or programming language is called automation.<br>
Automation testing is used to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and coverage of Software testing.<br>
Automation test engineer uses automation testing tools to automate the manual design test cases without any human interference.<br>
And these testing tools can control the execution of tests, access the test data, and compares the actual result against the expected result.<br>
